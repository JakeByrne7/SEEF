# SEEF
A Structure Extraction and Ellipse Fitting (SEEF) algorithm used to fit ellipses to structure within elliptical astronomical images, originally created for protoplanetary disks but can be applied to alternative astronomical structures. Operates on .fits files but may be altered for other formats.

This page is a work in progress. A ReadTheDocs will come available in the following weeks to act as a user guide for the code.
